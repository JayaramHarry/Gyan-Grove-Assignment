## Explanation of Design and Technical Decisions
### Design:
- **User Interface**: The UI is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear categories, search functionality, and recognizable icons for common actions like favorites and search.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The codebase follows a component-based architecture, making it modular and easier to maintain and scale.

### Technical Decisions:
- **React**: React is chosen as the primary frontend library due to its component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and strong community support.
- **React Icons**: Icons from the `react-icons` library are used for better performance and flexibility in rendering icons as React components.
- **State Management**: `useState` hook is used for managing local component state, providing a simple and efficient way to handle state changes within components.
- **Effect Hook**: The `useEffect` hook is utilized for handling side effects like resizing the window and cleaning up resources to ensure better performance and prevent memory leaks.
